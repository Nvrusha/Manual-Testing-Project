# OpenCart Manual Testing Project
This repository demonstrates my manual testing expertise through the OpenCart e-commerce platform, an open-source online store management system. The project is focused on ensuring the robustness and quality of key e-commerce functionalities, including product management, order processing, customer workflows, and seamless API/database interactions. It aims to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring that users can navigate and complete purchases smoothly without encountering bugs or issues.

## Project  Overview:

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to conduct thorough manual testing of OpenCart’s key modules to identify any functional issues, ensure stable performance, and guarantee that customer transactions are error-free. This includes evaluating both front-end and back-end processes, ranging from user registration to order fulfillment, as well as testing the integration of APIs and database transactions.

By focusing on multiple types of testing—functional, regression, API, and database testing—this project not only covers basic user interactions but also ensures data integrity and proper backend functionality.

## Scope
### This project comprehensively tests all core features of the OpenCart platform, including but not limited to:

1. User registration and login processes.

2. Product search and filter functionality, ensuring users can easily find items.

3. Cart functionality including adding, updating, and removing products from the cart.

4. Checkout process covering payment methods, shipping options, and order confirmation.

5. Order history and user profile management features.

### Additional focus was placed on:
Admin Panel Testing: Testing the admin capabilities, such as product management, customer management, and reporting tools.

Third-party Integrations: Validating the proper functioning of APIs for payment gateways, shipping services, and other external systems.

## Testing Methodologies:
1. ### Functional Testing:
Functional testing was carried out to verify that every feature of the OpenCart platform works as intended. This involved:

* Ensuring all links, buttons, and user interface elements were operational.
* Testing each user scenario from browsing products to completing a purchase.
* Verifying error handling for invalid inputs or failed transactions.

2. Regression Testing to ensure no new issues arise after updates.

3. API Testing using Postman to validate the platform's integration with external systems.

4. Database Testing to ensure the integrity and accuracy of data transactions in MySQL.

# Tools
1. Postman for API testing.

JIRA for bug tracking and reporting.

# Bug Reporting: 
Detailed test cases and defect logs created and maintained in JIRA.

# Outcomes:
Identification of critical bugs and improvement recommendations to enhance platform stability and user experience.

# How to Run the Tests:
1.Set up the OpenCart platform locally or in a testing environment.

2.Access the provided test cases and run manual tests against the platform.

3.Use Postman to execute API tests for various operations such as product retrieval and order placement.
