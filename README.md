Regression Testing to ensure no new issues arise after updates.
API Testing using Postman to validate the platform's integration with external systems.
Database Testing to ensure the integrity and accuracy of data transactions in MySQL.

# Tools
Postman for API testing.
JIRA for bug tracking and reporting.
Bug Reporting: Detailed test cases and defect logs created and maintained in JIRA.
Outcomes: Identification of critical bugs and improvement recommendations to enhance platform stability and user experience.
How to Run the Tests:
Set up the OpenCart platform locally or in a testing environment.
